# Interactiveweb
This is the second webpage in continuation of my personal portfolio (Task 1). It demonstrates my ability to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive web features using:
> HTML for structure
> CSS for styling and responsive layout
> JavaScript for form validation, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content
> Key Features:
> Contact Form with real-time validation
> To-Do List where users can add/remove tasks dynamically
> Image Gallery where users can upload image URLs and remove them
> Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid
> The page is themed to match my main portfolio and acts as its extension
